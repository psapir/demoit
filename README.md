# Pre-recorded demo template

Doing live demos can be a risky challenge. You rely on internet connectivity, the platform working at the moment of the demo, loading times and more. 

The goal of a demo should be to demonstrate your solution or ideas and not that what you are doing is actually in real time.

For that reason, many years ago I switched my approach to pre-recorded demos. While I still have to prepare the demo, record it and practice, this solution takes away the preassure of relying on external factors that have nothing to do with my demo but can drammatically change the quality of a presentation.

This repository contains a boiler plate template to run pre-recorded demo videos in a browser window. 

To get started follow these simple steps:

1. Pre-record your demo in full high definition resolution (1920 x 1080) making sure the aspect ration is wide (16:9) I recommend using an external monitor and using OBS Studio for your recording: https://obsproject.com/
2. Edit your recording to your liking, I recommend [Clipchamp](https://clipchamp.com/en/windows-video-editor/) for Windows or [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193) for Mac. 
3. Save your video as demo.mp4. 
4. Store the demo.mp4 file and the index.html file locally in your computer in the same location. 
5. Open the index.html file in a new browser window and enter full screen mode in the browser.
6. Press the Spacebar key to start the video and the Enter key to pause the video when needed. 
7. To refresh the video, exit full screen mode and refresh your browser window.
